# How to play this game:
## At fist you have to choose you car and click submit. Then the game starts.
## You can move your car to left and right with arrow buttons.
## If you press space button, the car goes verry fast for 30 seconds and it will be loud!
- NOTE! (if you want to stop the car before 30 seconds, press the space button again so the car goes with normal speed)
## If you press letter "t", you can hear the car exhaust sound.
## There are some rocks in your way. if you colide with them, your car's health decreases and if your car's health reaches 0, the game finishes and the time you have been playing will be appear on the screen.
